## TIPE

For my CPGE exams, we had to create a project on the theme of "Health and Prevention". The idea I had was design a program that created a artificial intelligence that would notice breaks on bones x-ray images. The type of AI I ended up choosing was a Convoluted Neural Network, very useful to recognize patterns in images.

I first tested my program to make an AI that would recognize a set of handwritten numbers, with success. So I then used the same program to achieve my main goal.

Except the fact that my computer wasn't near powerful enough to perform correctly, it worked to a certain extent. In the end I got 75/100.
